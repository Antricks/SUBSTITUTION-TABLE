# Substitution Table

Just another web client for WebUntis

 * Requires a PHP Server to run.
 * Modify the value of `$api_schoolName` in `php/getData.php` to get data from a different organization. (The school name is the same as the one used in the JSON-data for the API-request. If you have questions on how to get to it, feel free to contact us: [antricks.dev@posteo.de](mailto:antricks.dev@posteo.de) )
 * For license info have a look at `LICENSE.txt`

Auto-deployed for testing [here](https://demo.antricks.dev/substitution-table)
