# Plan B

A minimalist substitution plan for WebUntis

 * Requires a PHP Server (developed with PHP 7.4) to run.
 * Modify the values of `$api_schoolName` and `"formatName"` in `php/getData.php` to get data from a different organization. (If you have any questions about these data fields, feel free to contact us: [antricks.dev@posteo.de](mailto:antricks.dev@posteo.de) )
 * For license info have a look at `LICENSE.txt`
